            <h3>I downloaded the zip file, now what?</h3>

            <p>
                Using the terminal, or cmd line, <code>cd</code> into your extracted directory and run
                <code>$ vagrant up</code>. This will kick-off the initial process.
            </p>

            <p>
                Vagrant will download the box file, which can take a few minutes. It will only have to do this once, even
                if you create separate environments later on.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, it will hand control over to Puppet which will begin setting up your environment by installing
                required packages and configuring tools as desired.
            </p>

            <p>
                You will then be able to ssh into your new box with <code>$ vagrant ssh</code>. You can also access any
                virtual hosts you created by editing your hosts file and creating entries (ex:
                <code>192.168.123.101 puphpet.dev www.puphpet.dev</code>). To shut down the VM, simply run
                <code>$ vagrant halt</code>. To start it back up run <code>$ vagrant up</code> again. Destroy it with
                <code>$ vagrant destroy</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>Learn you some Vagrant</h3>

            <p>
                You may want to learn the basics of Vagrant CLI by
                <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/index.html">going here</a>. You really only need to learn the
                very basics - that is why I created this app for!
