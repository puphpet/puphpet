            <h3>The config file</h3>

            <p>
                Everything in your VM is controlled via the <code>puphpet/config.yaml</code> file. Here,
                you can choose which packages you want installed and change the settings for many things.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you change anything, you can have it take effect within your virtual machine by running
                <code>$ vagrant provision</code>. If you make changes before you actually spin up your vm,
                the changes will be applied on your first <code>$ vagrant up</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>Custom config file</h3>

            <p>
                You can create a custom config file at <code>puphpet/config-custom.yaml</code> to override
                anything that you have defined in <code>puphpet/config.yaml</code>. This file is ignored by
                Git by default. Simply copy the structure from <code>config.yaml</code> and replace the
                values you want. You can also create completely new keys to define functionality not present
                in PuPHPet by default!
