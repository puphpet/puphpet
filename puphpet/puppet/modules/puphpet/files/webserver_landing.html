                    <h1 class="page-header">Congratulations! You are pretty awesome.</h1>

                    <p class="lead">You are well on your way to a highly customized server.</p>

                    <h3>However, if you are seeing this page, it means you are using IP Address, not virtual host!</h3>

                    <p>This is probably not the page you want.</p>

                    <p>
                        This page is being served from <code>/var/www/html/index.html</code>, and is the default
                        vhost (virtual host) that comes with most web servers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What you want to do is to add all vhosts that you defined on
                        <a href="https://puphpet.com" target="_blank">PuPHPet.com</a> to your hosts file.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On OSX and Linux, this is located at <code>/etc/hosts</code>, on Windows it is located at
                        <code>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Add a line with the IP address of this server and all vhosts you chose. For example, if the
                        IP address is <code>192.168.100.1</code>, and you chose vhost <code>awesome.dev</code>,
                        you will want to enter the following:
                    </p>

                    <pre>192.168.100.1 awesome.dev www.awesome.dev</pre>

                    <p>
                        If you forgot the IP address you chose, check the config file at
                        <code>puphpet/config.yaml</code>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Still running into problems?</h3>

                    <p>
                        First, <a href="https://github.com/puphpet/puphpet/blob/master/archive/puphpet/shell/ascii-art/important-notices.txt"
                                  target="_blank">read the instructions here.</a>
                        Seriously, read the instructions first!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If that does not solve your issue, head over to the
                        <a href="https://github.com/puphpet/puphpet/issues" target="_blank">PuPHPet Github issue track</a>
                        and create a new ticket. Make sure to include the contents of your
                        <code>puphpet/config.yaml</code> file (and make sure to indent it by 4 spaces to enable
                        Github's code syntax) and any error messages you ran into.
                    </p>

                    <p>Good luck, and happy programming!</p>
