# Contributing

Welcome to my stuff, really, take it, it's GPL. Just remember to attribute it back to me. If your changes are visible to on GitHub, I'll pull features back from your forks when the look good.

I'll also consider Pull Requests via GitHub, but please target them on to the `pull_here` branch rather than to `master`, this gives me a chance to check them out and deal with silly issues, like how my IDE used to put hard tabs in everything when I really wanted spaces.

I like tests, but I've still got to pick up how that works with Puppet.
